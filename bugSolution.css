This solution uses the `!important` flag to ensure the inner `div`'s styling takes precedence. While using `!important` isn't always recommended, this demonstrates a way to override the specificity conflict. A better solution would involve restructuring the CSS selectors for better specificity management.  A different solution could be to use a more specific selector for the inner div to ensure it overrides the outer div's styles.
